That's not the case for Moto E 2nd Generation although it supersedes Moto E 1st Gen in many ways. Now at this price range, there are competitors like Redmi 2 Prime 4G, Yu Yuphoria and others, and many people would prefer them more! In fact 2nd Gen is almost a disappointment with problems not associated with 1st gen like lagging, hanging, restarting etc."
+"As any Motorola phone this one is also superbly built; the curved back gives a great grip. The rear cam is the same 5 MP with auto focus, and there's a front facing VGA (0.3 MP) cam for video calls. Flash is still missing. No compass, no LED Notification. OTG support is there."
+"A 4.5 inch screen with 960 x 540 resolutions is not bad, considering it has got IPS Display, Corning Gorilla Glass 3, Anti-smudge Coating. Ram remains at 1 GB but it's almost a norm even for budget phone these days to get 2GB.";
